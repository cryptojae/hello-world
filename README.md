# hello-world
First repository


Hello to whoever is reading!

I am new to coding, I've just started my coding classes at Old Dominion University.
I've always been into coding since I was younger, my father was a software developer so I know a little bit of Java from him.

I'm here hoping that I could learn as much as possible before graduation!
